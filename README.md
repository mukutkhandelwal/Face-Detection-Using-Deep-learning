# Face-Detection-Using-Deep-learning

An End To End deep learning face detection  application with openCV with pre-trained deeplearning face detector present in the library which is present in the Deep neural network(DNN) module of openCV.

Using the  dnn module with the Caffe models there are 2 files needed :
1. .prototxt file which contains the model architecture
2. .caffemodel which contains the weights for thw model 

These can be downloaded From [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/dnn/face_detector)

Here are some sample images from video_detection File
